Week 4 — Specifications

Requirements: 
Program must read from Excel-file (.xlsx) (old file, 2006-2016, is example, new file, 2017-2020, is to be read) and get data from specific columns.
Try download from URL in column "AL". If this fails, download from URL in column "AM". 
Provide feedback to user if download succeeded or failed. Write to file. 
Downloaded file to be named according to column "BRNummer". 
Limit to ten downloads while at Specialisterne. 
Error handling is important.

Structure: 
FileHandler class. 
	Read .xlsx file — using ClosedXML. 
	Write to text file. 
DownloadManager class. 
	Download file by URL. 
	Main URL and fallback URL(s). 
README.
	Required package to read excel files only functions on Windows.
UML diagram.
	¯\_(ツ)_/¯



Presentation: 
- What is the assignment. 
- My approach; no way I'm making UI. 
  - Re-use file handler from last week's assignment. Problems with converting to reading .xlsx file type. Looked into OleDb, ended up with ClosedXML. 
- Structure. Error handling. Object-oriented programming; I rely heavily on DataTable objects. 
- Package used. ClosedXML because the alternative requires a license for commercial use (which the course is not, but the assignment alleges to be).
