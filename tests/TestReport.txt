Classes and methods are intuitively organized, and naming is consistent and descriptive (except: is there a meaningful difference between a handler and a manager?).
Documentation overall is good, but class descriptions would be welcome for understanding the class' responsibilities.
Certain methods are long and could gain from being refactored into more, smaller methods.
High coupling between classes, including classes imported from packages - this meant the code required refactoring to be easily unit tested.
Many problems are ignored and operations skipped, which matches the program's specifications.
However, certain potential exceptions regarding misformatted input are not taken into account.

Did not perform unit testing on FileHandler and DownloadManager.
Did not perform integration testing.
